Description: 
    For complicated regression tasks, it is not entirely clear what 
    the best approach is for solving problems. Often, analysts and practitioners
    will use multiple methods and select the best problem based on cross-validation.
    However, another approach is to weight the values according to a relatively
    simple aggregation scheme. We include multiple of such aggregation methods
    so that arbitrary regressors can be used in conjunction to make a final, more
    optimal predictor.
