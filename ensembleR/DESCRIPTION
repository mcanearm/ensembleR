Description: For complicated regression tasks, it is not entirely clear what 
the best approach is for solving problems. Often, analysts and practitioners
will use multiple methods and select the best problem based on cross-validation.
However, another approach is to weight the values according to a relatively
simple aggregation scheme. We include multiple of such aggregation methods
so that arbitrary regressors can be used in conjunction to make a final, more
optimal predictor.
