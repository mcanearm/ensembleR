# ensembleR Guided Usage

We're going to go through a simple guided test for regression examples. Let's use the abalone dataset.

## Running Code

Let

```{r}

fitModelMatrix <- 
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this 

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
