1.Introduction about this document
This document is created in order to provides step-by-step guidance on how to download and use the ensembleR package from GitHub

2.Preparation for devtools package in R
Before install ensembleR, please insure you have installed "devtools" in R:
```{r}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
```
3.Download the ensembleR zip and library the package
、、、{r}
devtools::install_local("/Username/ensembleR-dev/ensembleR")
library(ensembleR)
、、、、
If no error occurs, the package is successfully installed.
These packages have more recent versions available.

4.We're going to go through a simple guided test for regression examples. Let's use the abalone dataset.

## 4.1 List Available Functions
After loading the package, you can list all available functions using:
```r
ls("package:ensembleR")
```
Expected output:
```plaintext
[1] "abalone"                         "bootLM"                          "fit_char_encoder"               
[4] "fit_models"                      "fitAggregationFunction"          "fitAggregationFunction_bootLM"  
[7] "fitAggregationFunction_EM"       "fitAggregationFunction_lm"       "fitAggregationFunction_quantile"
[10] "rmse"
```
##4.2Example:Using the `abalone`dataset

If the package includes built-in datasets like `abalone`, you can load and inspect it:

```r
# Load the dataset
data(abalone)
str(abalone)
# Summarize the data
summary(abalone)
